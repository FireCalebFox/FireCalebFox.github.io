        Welcome to my first website. I decided to fill it with content that the internet doesn't have, which, 
          naturally, took a very long time. This all is listened to by myself, slowed down to very slow in some points.

      <h2>Creed- Why? lyrics:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Cradle up the people that's look-ing for power seeking relief</p>
    <p>Energy taken from all of my joy to feed a thief</p>
    <p>Modern faded notion, lookin' back on the original plan</p>
    <p>Religion's sacred hope ends stealing question to go demand</p>
    <br>
    <p>Why, Why, Why oh why?</p>
    <p>Why, why, oh why?</p>
    <p>Why, why, Why oh why?</p>
    <p>Why, Why, Why oh why oh why oh why oh why</p>
    <br>
    <p>Searchin', Waitin', Hopin', nothing in my hand...</p>
    <p>Braught this lackless question, need to know why, know why</p>
    <p>Understanding Nothing, completely insane</p>
    <p>More lovin' questions swell the brain</p>
    <br>
    <p>Why, Why, Why oh why?</p>
    <p>Why, why, oh why?</p>
    <p>Why, why, Why Ohhh Why?</p>
    <p>Why, Why, WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY OH WHY</p>
    <br>
    <p>Got up in the sky</p>
    <p>I'll wait if you'll try</p>
    <p>See me humble, see me cry</p>
    <p>The only question: I need to know why?</p>
    <br>
    <p>Whyyyyyyyy, oh Why?</p>
    <p>Whyyyyyyyy, oh Why?</p>
    <p>Whyyyyyyyy, oh Why?</p>
    <br>
